Groovy GDK 2.1.7 installation: http://groovy.codehaus.org/Installing+Groovy



Pre-requisites:
  - Java 7 JDK is installed 
  - %JAVA_HOME% environment variable has been set
  - %JAVA_HOME%\bin is in your PATH variable

Installation is much like the Java installation:
  - Unzip groovy distribution into a folder on the file system
  - Create %GROOVY_HOME% environment variable and set it to the directory you unzipped the distribution
  - Put %GROOVY_HOME%\bin is in your PATH variable

  At Command Prompt (where you place the groovy code), type: groovy athena-1 ABC


  If you do not want to install Groovy, just copy/paste the code into: http://groovyconsole.appspot.com/
  And then, hard code the "word" variable
  

  ** I also package this into a jar file if you just want to run it using 'java -jar athena-1.jar CHEESE'
